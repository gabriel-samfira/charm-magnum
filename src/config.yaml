  openstack-origin:

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

  cluster-user-trust:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Controls whether to assign a trust to the cluster user or not. You will
      need to set it to True for clusters with volume_driver=cinder or
      registry_enabled=true in the underlying cluster template to work. This is
      a potential security risk since the trust gives instances OpenStack API
      access to the cluster's project. Note that this setting does not affect
      per-cluster trusts assigned to the Magnum service user.
  cert-manager-type:
    type: string
    default: barbican
    description: |
      Certificate Manager plugin. Use barbican in production. Requires barbican
      to be present in your OpenStack deployment. Choices are:
        * x509keypair
        * barbican
  notification-driver:
    type: string
    default: "messaging"
    description: |
      The Oslo messaging notification driver option to be used. Choices are:
        * messaging
        * messagingv2
        * routing
        * log
        * test
        * noop

    description: |
      A space-separated list of network drivers that are allowed to be used by
      clusters.
  default-network-driver:
    type: string
    default: calico
    description: |
      The default network driver to use for clusters.
  enforce-new-defaults:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      This option controls whether or not to use old deprecated defaults when
      evaluating policies. If ``True``, the old deprecated defaults are not going
      to be evaluated. This means if any existing token is allowed for old defaults
      but is disallowed for new defaults, it will be disallowed. It is encouraged
      to enable this flag along with the ``enforce_scope`` flag so that you can get
      the benefits of new defaults and ``scope_type`` together. If ``False``, the
      deprecated policy check string is logically OR'd with the new policy check
      string, allowing for a graceful upgrade experience between releases with new
      policies, which is the default behavior.
  additional-ca-certs:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      Additional CA certificates to send to cluster nodes.
